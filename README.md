I do not know whether it is necessary to push cvs files to github in order for our TA to run our ipython notebooks or not. H
However, I tried to push the cvs files that I used to my github, but there is an error message saying that the maximum size of file uploaded
is 100 MB. Please let me know if this is an issue, and how to fix it. Thank you so much.
